## About

Welcome to my webpage! I am an H.C. Wang Assistant Professor at [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu/). I am interested in geometric analysis, convex geometry, several complex variables, and geometric flows.

I completed my PhD in 2025 at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu/) under the supervision of [Yanir A. Rubinstein](https://math.umd.edu/~yanir/). Prior to that, I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at Cambridge University in 2018, and received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the [University of Athens](https://www.math.uoa.gr/) in 2017.

## Outreach
Over the past three years, I have mentored five undergraduate projects for the [Directed Reading Program](http://drp.math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland: 
- Alejandro Escoto, *[Geometric Flows in Python](/assets/files/Geometric_Flows_in_Python.pdf)*, Fall 2023
- Brooke Guo, *[The isoperimetric inequality from antiquity to Steiner](/assets/files/Isoperimetric_inequality.pdf)*, Spring 2023
- Alejandro Escoto, *[The de Rham cohomology](/assets/files/DeRham.pdf)*, Fall 2022
- Abdulrahman Alenazi, *[The 2-dimensional Mahler conjecture](/assets/files/2DMahler_.pdf)*, Spring 2022
- Aryan Kaul, *[The 2-dimensional Brouwer fixed point theorem](http://drp.math.umd.edu/Project-Slides/KaulSpring2021.pdf)*, Spring 2021

I also gave a talk at the [Interaction between Convex Geometry and Complex Geometry REU](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/REU2024Darvas.html) at the University of Maryland on July 1, 2024.
