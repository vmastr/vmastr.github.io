[magicMahler](https://github.com/vmastr/magicMahler) is a Python library designed for geometric computations involving polytopes in the plane. Key features include calculating essential notions from my research:

    <li>{{ feature }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

Here is an example of a Graham scan implementation:
